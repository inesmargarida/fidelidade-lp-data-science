# Final Project

### Welcome to the last stage of these Learning Paths!

It's time you put into practice all the knowledge you've acquired in the last months.

You're expected to pick your own project idea and be able to:

#### Project Structure:

    1. EDA;
    2. Feature Engineering;
    3. Model Creation and serving;
    4. Use pylint and pytest;
    5. Create tests folder for project testing;
    6. Add CI/CD Workflow
    7. Add requirements.txt, conda.yaml or pyproject.toml with project requirements;
    8. Write clean code following Uncle Bob's (your favourite grandpa);

#### Project Ideas:

 - Use a current/ previous/ future project you have, to develop with-in your work and fully develop it with python, respecting the criteria in Project Structure;

 - Come up with your own project theme suggestion and share it with us. 
 
    -Examples:
        1. Did you always want to automate an irrigation system, and  based on multiple factors run predictions to understand the optimal amount of water you should give to your plants? Now it's the right time to put it into practice!

        2. Do you want to play around and build some product using Large Language Models (LLM's)? Why not testing and build your idea, creating a POC?

#### Timeline:

- It is expected that you manage to develop this project in 2 weeks, even though if it takes longer, we'll still support you and guide you, making sure you reach your target goal!
